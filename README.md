# Jacobi

Once a repo for a school project, now a growing collection of interesting algorithms and problem-solving techniques I've learned from platforms like LeetCode, Hackerrank, and more.

## ðŸ§  What's Inside

This repo features:

- Classic algorithms (e.g., matrix operations, recursion, dynamic programming)
- Data structure utilities (linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Coding challenge solutions with comments and explanations
- Math-heavy snippets (like determinant calculation, Gauss Jacobi algo, etc.)

## ðŸ“š Origin

Originally created as part of a school project involving numerical methods (like the Gauss Jacobi method for solving linear systems), this repo has evolved into a personal archive of useful algorithms and implementations.
